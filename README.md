Sarah Wattles: Module 1 Challenge

Here is my attempt at the ![Module 1 Challenge](https://swattles.github.io/module01/Develop/) 


You can see the a mockup of the a mockup of the webpage here. 
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

Thank you for all of your feedback and attention to my work. I hope you enjoy! 

Have a fantastic day!
